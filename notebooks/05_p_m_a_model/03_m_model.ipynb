    "# Energy Envelope Test for Planetary Modulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the \"energy envelope model\" as a filter, we systematically examine which fundamental frequencies (signals in the residuals) have their energy truly modulated by the 11-year planetary cycle (fitted SSN). This method (energy envelope of high-frequency signals vs. low-frequency driving force) is physically more interpretable than the \"full frequency comb\" feature engineering of LGBM. We will no longer be limited to 20-35 days, but will traverse all relevant physical frequency bands (rotation, Rieger, annual, QBO), and quantify their respective \"modulation relationship\" with the 11-year cycle. The complete code for filtering modulated frequencies is provided below. It will: define a series of physical frequency bands of interest (in days). Loop through 4 models (M8+2, M0+3...). For each model, loop through each frequency band. Core step: extract the energy envelope of that frequency band, and (using a simple LGBM) fit $Y_{envelope} = f(X_{planetary\\_fit})$, calculating R² on the test set. Finally, a table is summarized showing the average R² for each frequency band across the four models, telling you which frequencies are \"worth\" being modulated."
